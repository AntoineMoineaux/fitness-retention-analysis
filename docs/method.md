# Analytical Method

1. Validate raw data (volumes, date coverage, sanity checks)
2. Define the analytical grain (user-week)
3. Identify habit intensity signals (workouts per week)
4. Define a North Star metric linked to retention
5. Perform cohort-based retention analysis
6. Translate insights into product decisions

The focus of this project is diagnosis, not experimentation.
